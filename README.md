# Linear Algebra using python

Linear algebra algorithms and programs made with python

## Important Info:
 - Use numpy's implimentation instead of this, if performnace is a factor.
 - the code here is to showcase the inner workings of the algorithm and is a form of note taking so that I don't forget the teachings in linear algebra.  

 - main.py and test.py are test files that i use to check the validity of the code so it is separate from the linear algebra repo

 - many topics in linear algebra overlaps with topics in discrete math, so if an algorithm is not in this repo, check the discrete math repo to check if its not there.

## dependencies/ used libraries:

## dependencies:
- numpy (most functions have the option of using numpy and works together with matplotlib)
- pandas (used to store data)
- pickle (used to save data as a .pkl file)
- matplotlib (used for visualization)
- collections (used in few files to access stacks and queues)
- random
- math (used for trig functions)
- itertools
- fractions
- string (used to parse string inputs)

## updates and future plans

### updates:
 - as of 4/21/2020, working on finishing the fundamental ideas in Lin-algebra, applications will be touched after everything is done. 

### future plans:
 - first I will continue and finish the files that are in the repo 
 - Then I will go into applications in physics and modeling
